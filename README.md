This repository contains the two projects developed by our teams during the **AI Hackathon** organized by **GDG (Google Developer Groups)** in Milan, may 2025.

## 🧠 Edutech Track Projects

### 🥈 Team XGBrats – *Second Place Winner*

#### **Project: Lorax**

**Lorax** is an AI-powered educational add-on for the **Braynr** ecosystem, designed to enhance learning through structured organization, content personalization, and gamified engagement.

It tackles two common student challenges:

* Navigating unstructured materials
* Staying motivated throughout the study journey

**Key Features:**

* 🧭 **Dynamic knowledge graph generation** to visually map out topics
* 🎯 **Personalized content** tailored to individual learning styles
* 🃏 **Gamified flashcard system** introducing a competitive twist to revision

Fully integrated with Braynr, Lorax repurposes user-generated content and existing tools to deliver a smart, customized study experience.

### 🦢 Team Blackswans

#### **Project: MathQuest**

**MathQuest** is an interactive educational app that turns math learning into an engaging adventure.

To progress through the story, players must **solve math problems**, making the experience both intellectually stimulating and narratively rewarding. The blend of storytelling and problem-solving is designed to keep users immersed while reinforcing mathematical skills in a dynamic, game-based environment.
